# Ahold_product_detector
This repository implements a product detector for products in the Albert Heijn supermarket


### Install this ROS Package for Ubuntu

Before starting, make sure to have ROS Noetic installed: http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation

After installation, initialize a workspace in order to build and run the ROS package. Do this by running the following commands:

```console
mkdir YOUR_WORKSPACE_NAME
```
> cd YOUR_WORKSPACE_NAME

> mkdir src

> cd src

We want to have the ROS package inside the 'src' directory, so now that we are in here we can clone the repository:

> git clone git@github.com:stijnla/Ahold_product_detector.git

Now return to your workspace directory, source the ROS environment if you haven't done so, and build the package by running the following lines:

> cd ..

> source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

> catkin build








, and to source the ROS environment in your terminal whenever you want to run the code.
